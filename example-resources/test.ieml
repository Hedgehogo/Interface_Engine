				Linux kernel
				============
				---
				There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
				be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
				Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.
				---
				In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
				``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:
				---
				https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/
				---
				There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
				several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
				---
				Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
				requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
				the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
